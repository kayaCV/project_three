Used jQuery library to enhance the registration form for a fictional conference called "FullStack Conf."
Added my own code to make the form more user-friendly by:
* adding customized and conditional behavior and interactivity
* validating user input and providing helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields.
